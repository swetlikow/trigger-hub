    <p class="text-center mx-auto">
      Most people think pain comes from nerves, joints, or bones. In reality, a huge amount of
      chronic discomfort comes from
      <strong>trigger points</strong> — small, tight knots in your muscles that cause pain in other
      areas of your body. <br /><br />
      Tight spot in your neck → headache.<br />
      Tight muscle in your lower back → hip or leg pain.<br />
      Tight chest muscle → upper back tension.
      <br /><br />
      You feel the pain — but the real source is hidden. Trigger Hub helps you find it.

    <h2 class="section-title">What Are Trigger Points?</h2>
    <p class="text-center mx-auto">
      Trigger points are tight knots inside your muscles. They form when fibers become overloaded,
      strained, stressed, or not allowed to recover. A trigger point can cause pain right where it
      is — or send pain far away (this is called <strong>referred pain</strong>). <br /><br />
      The good news? Trigger points are treatable, and most people can learn to manage them with
      simple techniques.

      Know your pain comes from triggers, but a strong myopressure massage is hard to do yourself.
      Professionals are expensive, and most classical massagers don’t understand trigger points.
      <br /><br />
      The ideal solution is to find someone with the same problem as you. You can help each other,
      exchange massages, and share gold-level information about trigger points.
