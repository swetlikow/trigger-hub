    <p class="lead mt-3 mx-auto">
      Trigger points don’t disappear on their own. Muscles won't relax from stretching, rest, or
      pills. The real solution is targeted physical pressure.

    <h2 class="section-title text-center">The Only Real Treatment: Myopressure</h2>
    <p>
      The only proven way to treat trigger points and restore muscle health is
      <strong>myopressure</strong> — a deep, firm, sometimes intense pressure technique aimed at
      physically breaking down trigger points and fibrosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trigger points are hardened knots in muscle fibers. They don’t dissolve with gentle massage,
      pills, ointments, or exercises. They must be mechanically destroyed.

    <h3 class="section-title text-center">Key Principles</h3>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Find the trigger point:</strong> learn to palpate the muscle and detect small,
        painful nodules.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Recognize fibrosis:</strong> long-term damage feels rough, stiff, and rope-like.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Identify the right muscle:</strong> pain is usually referred, so the painful area is
        rarely the source.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>Treatment frequency:</strong> mild points daily, severe ones every 2–3 days.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        <strong>After treatment:</strong> warm the muscle, stretch gently, and move slowly.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- What Not to Do -->
  <section class="mb-5 p-4 bg-white shadow-sm">
    <h2 class="section-title text-center">What Does <strong>Not</strong> Work</h2>
    <p>These methods do not heal muscles and should be avoided completely:</p>

    <div class="avoid-item mb-2">❌ Any kind of exercise</div>
    <div class="avoid-item mb-2">❌ Physical activity (gym, sports, hard training)</div>
    <div class="avoid-item mb-2">❌ Hypothermia (cold exposure tightens muscles)</div>
    <div class="avoid-item mb-2">❌ Stress (creates new trigger points)</div>
    <div class="avoid-item mb-2">❌ Ointments, pills, injections — none repair muscle fibers</div>
    <div class="avoid-item mb-2">❌ Stretching cold or damaged muscles — increases tearing</div>

    <p class="fw-semibold mt-3">
      A muscle must be warmed, pressed, and released <strong>before</strong> any stretching.
